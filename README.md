# React_Expense_Planner

My first ever react project posted on GitHub. This is a very simple expense tracker that has a graphical chart representation of a user's expenses per month using the concepts of two-way binding & lifting the state up. It also uses functional components with React Hooks. This application has the capability to gather user's input so that the user can add their own expenses. 
## Usage
```
npm install

# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for prod
npm run build
```
